# Skylerto's Dotfiles

Bits in pieces from everywhere that I have found useful, my goal is to make an
executable to setup and configure any dev machine I get to work on.

Get em on OSX:

```
$ bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.github.com/skylerto/dotfiles/master/src/os/setup.sh)"
```

## ThunderBird

To get exchange calendar working with Thunderbird, you will need the following
extensions:

- Lighting  
- ./exchangecalendar-3.9.0y.xpi
